 Esthetician
“It’s been a while. How have you been?”

  Client
“Life’s been busy lately. But I’m excited to finally get this treatment.”

  Esthetician
“Good. You should take time for yourself more often.”
“Go ahead and lie down.”

*lying down on bed sounds*

*screen black fades out and we can see the client on the bed*

2. Brush:
Esthetician
“Alright, we’ll start with a gentle cleanse.”

  Client
“Mhm… that feels nice.”

  Esthetician
“Busy week?”

  Client
“Yeah. All the same stuff, really.”

  (pause)

  Client
“I’m glad I could finally come here.”

  Esthetician
“This should help you relax.”

3. Sponge in water bowl (hover)

  Esthetician
“Let me know if the water’s too warm.”

  Client
“Okay.”

  Esthetician
“Anything fun planned after this?”

  Client
“…No. I need to go back home.”

  Esthetician
“Makes sense. It’s good to keep routines.”

4. Sponge drying her face

  Client
“That’s not too warm...”

  Esthetician
“I’m glad.”

  (pause)

  Esthetician
“I like your earrings.”

  Client
“Oh—thanks. My husband got them for me.”

  Esthetician
“Oh, he has good taste.”

  Client
“...Yeah.”

5. Pimple popping

  Esthetician
“This one might pinch.”

  Client
“It’s fine. I’m used to it.”

  (pop)

  Client
“…Sorry. That sounded weird.”

  Esthetician
“Don’t worry about it.”

  Client
“Thank you.”

6. Brush hair

  Esthetician
“Tell me if I’m being too rough.”

  Client
“It’s okay.”

  Esthetician
“Your hair’s a bit tangled.”

  Client
“Sorry.”

  (short pause)

  Esthetician
“You should take better care of it.”

  Client
“…I try.”

7.Gua-sha

  Esthetician
“What did you mean earlier, when you said you’re used to it?”

  Client
“Forget about it. It’s nothing.”

  (Guasha is pressed on the client, screen glitches, we see bruises on the client and she has a black eye.)

  Esthetician
“Oh. Sorry.”

  (Screen glitches and it’s back to normal.)

8. Place the face mask

  Esthetician
“This’ll sit for a few minutes.”

  Client
“I love this part.”

  (beat)

  Esthetician
“How are things with your boyfriend?”

  Client
“Oh. You know. The usual.”

  (pause)

  Client
“He worries about me a lot.”

  Esthetician
“That means he cares.”



9. Taking off the mask (Refined)

Esthetician
“Alright. I’ll remove the mask now.”

Client
“…Okay.”

(The mask begins to peel.)

Client
“You know… sometimes I think about how things used to be.”

(Mask halfway — brief glitch. Blood appears on the esthetician’s hand and the client’s face.)

(A beat. The esthetician freezes.)

Client
“Um… is everything okay?”

(The esthetician gently presses the mask back down.)

Esthetician
“…It passes.”

(Pause.)

Client
“I don’t know. This feels wrong.”

(A second, harsher glitch.)

Client
“It used to be easy.”

Esthetician
“Easy doesn’t last.”
“That’s what people don’t tell you.”

(Peeling resumes. Blood remains.)

Client
“I thought if I tried harder, things wouldn’t feel like this.”

(Longer pause.)

Esthetician
“But instead, it made it worse.”

(Quiet.)

Client
“…Does it ever stop feeling like this?”

(The esthetician hesitates.)

Esthetician
“…You stop noticing.”

*screen glitches to black*
